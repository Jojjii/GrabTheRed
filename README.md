# GrabTheRed

Grab any red object near you, use it to steer a red car to capture some red flags, beware that hitting the boundary will be penalized (since every action has an equal and opposite reaction, so the faster you hit it, the further you will drive backwards !) 
With that being said, normal games are just too boring and easy xD

Here I wanted to challenge the control skills, the development of mind to focus on an internal game goal as well as limit their external comfort to achieve that goal !
